## Installation

Clone this repository or download the source code.


## Usage

Call `decomposition = require "decomposition"`
and then any of the following:

- `decomposition.pca(x)`,

- `decomposition.lda(x, y)`,

- `decomposition.lpp(x)`,

- `decomposition.npp(x)`,

- `decomposition.fastica(x)`.


Alternativly, you can use iTorch notebook and open `decomposition.ipynb`.
